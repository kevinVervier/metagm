# metagm: the metagenomic platform from Team162

In this page, we provide examples illustrating the different options offered by the platform.

## metagm_build module

This section describes the process of building databases for different softwares (Kraken, Bracken, Mash, ...) using a list of reference genomes.

## metagm_classify module

This section describes the process of classifying metagenomics sequencing reads to get both taxonomic and functional profiles.

## statistical analysis

This section provides some R snippets to do analysis using the metagm_classify output files. 

More details are given in the R vignette '.Rmd', also found in this repository.
